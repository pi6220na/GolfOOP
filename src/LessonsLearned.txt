Lessons Learned from Project One





Questions remaining:


Using the sub-class type to instantiate a new object:
Human human = new Human(playerIndex, name, HUMAN);
versus
Player player = new Human(playerIndex, name, HUMAN);
didn't seem to make any difference in function...


Needed empty methods/method signatures in super-class as well as sub-class



Doing the following "copy" didn't work. The cards were copied but
seemed to be references back to the originating array...
ArrayList<Card> workArray = new ArrayList<Card>(handArray);

This does work...
ArrayList<Card> workArray = new ArrayList<Card>();

        for (Card card : handArray) {

            Card newcard = new Card(card.getSequence(), card.getRank(),
                    card.getSuit(), card.getFacing());

            workArray.add(newcard);
